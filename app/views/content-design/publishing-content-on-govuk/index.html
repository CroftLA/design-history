    <p>DCT create, publish and manage DfE's content on GOV.UK</p>

    <p>Some of the links on this page go to the DfE intranet. If you don't have access to the intranet, ask a colleague with access to get the information for you.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="start-with-govuk-design-system">Creating prototypes for GOV.UK</h2>

    <p>You'll need to present content to DCT in a prototype format, so they can understand what you want. This can be as basic as a word doc or lucid board.</p>

    <p>Once you start thinking about your design, <a href="https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_category&sys_id=611828a6db6c2f403b929334ca9619f6" target="_blank">raise a ticket (opens intranet page in new tab)</a>  and work alongside DCT to develop it. You can find out how to engage their service and get further advice on the <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-publish-gov-uk.aspx" target="_blank">DCT intranet page (opens intranet page in new tab)</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="start-with-govuk-design-system">Buddy up on GOV.UK journeys</h2>

    <p>Buddying up is where a DCT content designer supports a DfE content designer through DCT publishing processes and collaborates on content design decisions.</p>

    <p>Buddying up should be done when content designers are:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>working on content that's planned to go on GOV.UK</li>
        <li>testing content in Whitehall as part of checking whether an information service should be built that does not sit on GOV.UK</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="start-with-govuk-design-system">Get an induction from DCT if you're using Whitehall</h2>

    <p>Get an induction from DCT if you've been given a Whitehall publisher account to work on GOV.UK content.</p>
    <p>This will give you an overview of DfE processes for GOV.UK content, including 2i checks and clearances. It also means that content will go through 3 people to check it.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="start-with-govuk-design-system">Get a review from DCT</h2>

    <p>Before it's published, all GOV.UK content needs to be checked by a DCT content designer to make sure it's accessible and follows the GOV.UK style guide.</p>

    <p>A 2i is a where a DCT content designer reviews the final draft of content in-line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/reviewing-and-approving-content" target="_blank"> GOV.UK 2i checklist (opens in new tab)</a> prior to publishing.</p>

    <p>A 2i is different to a peer review. Peer reviews can be done at any stage of the drafting process. Content which will be published on GOV.UK should be peer reviewed by a content designer from DCT.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="start-with-govuk-design-system">Get the right clearances</h2>

    <p>DfE has strict clearance requirements for all content published on GOV.UK.</p>

    <p>This usually involves clearance from a deputy director (DD) and from strategic communications at DfE.</p>

    <p>You may need to agree a publication date for certain content. This is to ensure the planning team know when the content will be published. It's important to let the planning team know if it's high level, as may require a no 10 grid slot. They can advise. </p>

If you do not have access to the DfE intranet, ask a colleague with access to get the information for you.</p>
    <p>DCT will publish the content to GOV.UK after 2i checks have been completed and clearances have been confirmed.</p>
